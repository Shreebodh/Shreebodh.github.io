<p>This is the far most amazing mobile software I've ever come across till date. Hands down! It is so easy to use and did I mention how fun it is? Playing with colours and shading will just take you to an outer space, not literally though. If I start creating something here, I will spend hours and hours to make it look nice. During this lockdown, this software has come handy to me. My time passes in the blink of an eye. Talking about my art, I am not really good with the faces so I tend not to give facial definition to my art but seriously, I love my art faceless

<p>Life is short. We are growing older with every second spent. So make your life here worthwhile. I don't seek out for perfection, I seek out for happiness. Just like a caterpillar that turns into a butterfly someday, I have turned into what I have become today. I am changing slowly but surely. So this is what I did this week. A simple looking animation! I used the app called 'Adobe Draw' which is an amazing software by the way if you are ever interested on creating a vector image of yourself or just want to create one by yourself. Plus it is 'FREE'. What do we want more than that right?

<p>As a teenager, I used to love One Direction. It is an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London, England 2010. I used to go crazy for all the five members. I still love listening to them. I love their songs. I used to own more than like 100 posters, some photo batches, clock, lockets, keyring and what not. I still love them but not how I used to think about them before when I was teenager. They were literally my angels. After I learned how Adobe-draw works, I did a digital portrayed of them and seriously, I am in love with it.</p>
